# CRS Simulator

## Intro

In order to help my Chinese friends finish his C++ homework, I just started this project. Help it helps.

It may has various kinds of errors. And may not 100% meet the standards of modern C++. 

**So please use with caution.**

## Install

I consciously want to make this program cross-platform, but the fact may not turn to be satisfying.

Make sure you have git, make, cmake installed.

1. Clone the repo `Kasugan0/CRS-Simulator`.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kasugan0/CRS-Simulator.git
    ```
    
2. Enter the root directory of the repo.
    ```
    cd CRS-Simulator
    ```

3. Create a new folder `build`.
    ```
    mkdir build
    ```

4. Enter the `build` directory.
    ```
    cd build
    ```

5. Generate Makefile.
	```
	cmake ..
	```
6. Make the executable file.
	```
	make
	```

Now you will find a executable file named `CRS Simulator`(POSIX System) or `CRS Simulator.exe`(WIndows). Here it is~
